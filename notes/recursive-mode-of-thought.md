# The Recursive Mode of Thought

Addition is usually defined formally by:

\\[
\\begin{array}{lcl}
  x + 0     &=& x \\\\
  x + (y+1) &=& (x + y) + 1 \\\\
\\end{array}
\\]
where the "plus one" function is assumed to be a part of the very
construction of the natural numbers themselves.

This definition played a fascinating role in the history of computation.
It predates both the formal definition of computation
and the formal theory of arithmetic, and it played a role in shaping both.

This is the story of the **primitive recursive functions**.
I like to call this collection of functions, tongue-in-cheek, the first
total functional programming language.
They have been studied extensively, and what follows is my own exposition.

## Background

The ancient Greeks drew a distinction between *actual infinity* and *potential infinity*.
The distinction may sound like hair-splitting at first, but it turns out to be fruitful.
Actual infinity involves the existence of infinite objects,
while potential infinity involves only an unending process.

The ancient Greeks were comfortable with potential infinity, but not actual infinity.
Aristotle is often attributed with inventing the slogan "infinitum actu non datur",
or "infinity is not actually given".
For example, Aristotle would not have approved of a construction on the set of even numbers,
but would have been fine with a construction manipulating an arbitrary even number.
Mathematicians got along just fine with potential infinity for a long time.

The reluctance to embrace actual infinity changed drastically in the 1800's
when it became clear that individual real numbers required actual infinity.
At the same time, it became clear how unintuitive infinite sets can be.
Georg Cantor and his explorations of trigonometric series led the math world into a renewed
[debate](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/how-math-works) about actual infinity.

Amidst these changes and uncertainty grew an increased desire to place mathematics
on more solid foundations.
In particular, many mathematicians sought to make *reasoning* about infinite objects
reducible to finite methods, and to free the structure of mathematical proofs from 
actual infinity.
Out of this maelstrom came the idea of the modern computer.

First-order logic was invented in the late 1800s,
independently by Charles Sanders Peirce and by Gottlob Frege.
Frege was attempting to ground mathematics in first-order logic, 
but in 1901 Bertrand Russell discovered a major flaw in his system.
This is now known as Russell's paradox, even though the paradox was known to Zermelo two years earlier.

Russel went on, together with Alfred Whitehead, to describe a logical formalism for mathematics
in *Principia Mathematica*.

The backdrop is now set for Thoralf Skolem's primitive recursive functions.
Principia Mathematica used quantifiers to define functions such as addition.
Quantifiers, which embody the phrases "for all" and "there exists", assume actual infinity.
In his paper "The foundations of elementary arithmetic established by means of the recursive
mode of thought, without the use of apparent variables ranging over infinite domains"[^skolem],
Skolem defines, by way of examples, the primitive recursive functions.
These functions, Skolem argues, provide an alternate foundation for mathematics
which rely only on potential infinity.

Skolem's paper is very accessible and fun to read.

## Definitions

Similar to the natural numbers, the primitive recursive functions have an inductive definition.
The domain of every primitive recursive function is the set of \\(k\\)-tuples of natural numbers
(for a fixed number \\(k\\)), which is denoted \\(\\mathbb{N}^k\\).
The range is always \\(\\mathbb{N}\\).

The **basic** primitive recursive functions are:

\\[
\\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}
\\hline
name & notation & function \\\\
\\hline
constant & C^k_y & (x_1, \ldots, x_k)\\mapsto y \\\\
\\hline
successor & S & x\\mapsto x+1 \\\\
\\hline
projection & P^k_i & (x_1, \\ldots, x_k)\\mapsto x_i\\text{, where } 1\\leq i\\leq k \\\\
\\hline
\\end{array}
\\]

A function is a **primitive recursive function** if it can be constructed using only
the basic functions, composition, and primitive recursion:

\\[
\\begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|}
\\hline
name & given & notation & function \\\\
\\hline
composition & g:\\mathbb{N}^m\\to\\mathbb{N} & g \\circ (h_1, \\ldots, h_m) & x_1\\ldots,x_k \\mapsto g(h_1(x_1, \\ldots, x_k), \\ldots, h_m(x_1, \\ldots, x_k)) \\\\
 & h_1,\\ldots,h_m:\\mathbb{N}^k\\to\\mathbb{N} & & \\\\
\\hline
primitive~recursion & g:\\mathbb{N}^k\\to\\mathbb{N} & R(g, h) & 
  f(0, x_1, \\ldots, x_k) \\mapsto g(x_1, \\ldots, x_k) \\\\
  & h:\\mathbb{N}^{k+2}\\to\\mathbb{N}
  & & f(x_0+1, x_1, \\ldots, x_k) \\mapsto h(x_0, f(x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_k), x_1, \\ldots, x_k) \\\\
\\hline
\\end{array}
\\]


### Examples

Addition is a primitive recursion function, as evidenced by:

\\[\\mathsf{add} \\equiv R(P^1_1, S\\circ P^3_2)
\\]

This is equivalent to the definition that we gave at the beginning
(except that the recursion is performed on the left summand).

Multiplication is a primitive recursion function:

\\[\\mathsf{mult} \\equiv R(C^1_0, \\mathsf{add} \\circ (P^3_2, P^3_3))
\\]

As we will explore, many functions are primitive recursive.

### Alternate description using for-loops

We can represent the primitive recursive functions as an imperative programming language[^loops]
which contains:

* variable assignments:
  * `X=0`
  * `X=X+1`
  * `X=Y`
* bounded loops: `FOR X ... END`

For example, we can implement truncated subtraction as

```
LOOP Y
  A = 0
    LOOP X
      X = A
      A = A + 1
    END
END
```

where we run the program with `X=x`, `Y=y`, and the program terminates with `xâˆ¸y` in `X`.


## Limitations

Before the Church-Turing thesis was widely accepted,
there was no precise and commonly accepted definition of algorithm
(even though we have written records of algorithms from ancient Mesopotamia).
For a brief window of time, the primitive recursive functions looked like a
reasonable candidate for the definition of algorithm.

Two students of Hilbert, Ackermann and Sudan, each produced the description of a function
which everyone would recognize as an algorithm, but which failed to be primitive recursive.

We now know that the addition of one more operator, namely the minimization operator \\(\\mu\\),
is enough to construct every function that meets our intuitive understanding of an algorithm.

### Fast-growing functions

The Ackermann and Sudan examples both employ a use of "double recursion",
creating functions which grow faster than any primitive recursive function.

The Ackermann function is defined as:

\\[
\\begin{array}{lcl}
    A(0, n) & = & n + 1 \\\\
    A(m+1, 0) & = & A(m, 1) \\\\
    A(m+1, n+1) & = & A(m, A(m+1, n)) \\\\
\\end{array}
\\]

The "diagonal" of the Ackermann function, \\(d(m)=A(m, m)\\), grows incredibly fast.
One way to see this is by comparison to the explosive up-arrow notation from Knuth.
A single arrow represents exponentiation:
\\(
x\\uparrow y = x^y
\\).
Two arrows represents repeated exponentiation, so that \\(x\\uparrow\\uparrow y\\)
is an exponential tower of \\(y\\)-many \\(x\\)'s.
For example, \\(2\\uparrow\\uparrow 3 =\\) $2^{2^2}$ (this is sometimes called tetration).
Three arrows represents iteration of the double arrow, etc.

Fixing \\(m=3\\), the function \\(A(3, n)\\) grows like \\(2\\uparrow n\\).

Fixing \\(m=4\\), the function \\(A(4, n)\\) grows like \\(2\\uparrow\\uparrow n\\).

In general, for \\(m\\geq 3\\):

\\[
A(m, n) = 2\\uparrow^{m-2}(n+3) - 3
\\]
where \\(\\uparrow^n\\) denotes \\(n\\)-many \\(\\uparrow\\)'s.

This is a mind bogglingly fast function.

It is possible to show that each individual primitive recursive function is
eventually bounded by a "row" of the Ackermann function.
In other words, if \\(f\\) is primitive recursive, then there exists numbers \\(m_0, n_0\\) such that
for all \\(n\\geq n_0\\), \\(f(n) \\leq A(m_0, n)\\).

Closely related to these "Ackermann rows" is the Grzegorczyk hierarchy, which categorize some
fast growing functions.[^odifreddi_ii].

#### Graph of the Ackermann function

As a humorous aside, the *graph* of the Ackermann function is, hilariously, primitive recursive.

In other words, the function
\\[
\\mathsf{AG}(m, n, y) =
\\begin{cases}
  1 & \\text{if } A(m, n) = y \\\\
  0 & \\text{otherwise}
\\end{cases}
\\]
is primitive recursive.

The trick is to notice that the size of the data needed to validate \\(y\\)
as a solution is not that large *relative to* \\(y\\).

To see this, notice that \\(A\\) is strictly monotonic in each coordinate. 
Moreover, in order to validate if \\(A(m, n)=y\\), you can first compute
the table of all values \\(A(a, b)\\) where \\(0\\leq a,b\\leq y\\),
marking any value which requires a recursive call not on the table with a dot.

For example, in order to verify \\(A(3, 1)=13\\), we can compute this table:

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |
|---|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |
| **0** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | \\(\\cdot\\) |
| **1** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) |
| **2** | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 13 | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) |
| **3** | 5 | 13 | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) | \\(\\cdot\\) |

In general, a function is primitive recursive *if and only if*:

* its graph is primitive recursive
* it is bounded by a primitive recursive function

### Totality

There is another fundamental property of the primitive recursive functions
which prevents them from capturing the notion of algorithm: *totality*.

Totality is a very nice property, but unfortunately any collection of total functions
which can be enumerated by an algorithm cannot contain all the algorithms.

A function that is defined on all inputs is called **total**.
This notion does not come up a lot in "normal" mathematics,
since "on all inputs" is usually trivially true
(by defining the inputs to be those where the function is defined).
In the computable world, however, it is difficult to determine which potential inputs are in the
domain.
Take, for example, the function $\mathsf{TP}$ which maps $n$ to the $n$-th pair of twin primes.
No one alive today knows if this function's domain is $\mathbb{N}$ (all natural numbers)
or just $\{0, 1, \ldots, N\}$ for some big $N$.

It is easy to see that the primitive recursive functions are all total,
meaning they are defined on all $\mathbb{N}^k$
(and we'll have more to say about this later, regarding Parson's theorem).

The same diagonal argument that is used to show that there are more real numbers than rational
numbers, the same diagonal argument used to prove that the halting set is not computable,
can also demonstrate that there is an algorithm which is not primitive recursive.

It is easy to see that we can enumerate the primitive recursive functions:

\\[ P_0, P_1, P_2, \\ldots
\\]

Consider the following algorithm \\(d\\) defined as:

\\[d(n) = P_n(n)+1
\\]

By construction, \\(d\\) is different from every primitive recursive function.


### Adding minimization

If we add one new construction technique to the primitive recursive functions,
we can describe every algorithm.
This new collection of functions is called the general recursive functions.

\\[
\\begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|}
\\hline
name & given & notation & function \\\\
\\hline
minimization & g:\\mathbb{N}^{k+1}\\to\\mathbb{N} & \\mu g & x_1,\\ldots,x_k\\mapsto \\\\
& & & \\text{ the least }y\\text{ such that }  \\\\
& & & \\text{ }g(y, x_1,\\ldots, x_k)=0 \\\\
\\hline
\\end{array}
\\]

Notice that for any given \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_k\\), 
the function \\(\\mu g\\) is only defined if there is at least one
\\(y\\) such that \\(g(y, x_1, \\ldots, x_k)=0\\).
For this reason, the diagonal argument cannot be applied to the general recursive functions.

A letter from Herbrand in 1931 sparked GÃ¶del to define them in 1934.

## Logical formalisms

The story of primitive recursion actually predates Skolem.
Hermann Grassmann's 1861 book "Lehrbuch der Arithmetik" seems to be the first appearance
of the formal definition of addition and multiplication by primitive recursion.
In the 1880's Grassmann's ideas were adopted by Charles Peirce, Richard Dedekind,
and Giuseppe Peano.
This group of mathematicians used these ideas for a logical foundation for arithmetic,
more similar to the Principia Mathematica than Skolem's paper.
This culminated in what we now call the Peano axioms,
which roughly capture the fact that the integers are a semiring.
Peano arithmetic is the name of the first order logical theory that assumes the Peano axioms.


Ackermann's 1924 dissertation[^ackPhD] was the first to create a logical theory directly
capturing the semantics of the primitive recursive functions.
We now call this system **primitive recursive arithmetic**.

The early 1920's also saw the rise of Hilbert's program,
which sought to find a solid foundation for mathematics resting on "finitistic" and formal grounds.
Ackermann was one of Hilbert's students, and his primitive recursive arithmetic
was the kind of system that Hilbert hoped could provide a foundation for math.
Peano arithmetic was another contender.
Hilbert's position was that mathematical results involving actual infinity could be trusted as
long as the proofs themselves relied only on potential infinity.

GÃ¶del showed in 1931 that the full scope of Hilbert's program was *impossible*[^incompleteness].
He was exquisitely careful to perform most of the argument using primitive recursive functions
(including a delightful use of the Chinese remainder theorem).

Emil Post very nearly discovered the same incompleteness theorem himself ten years earlier,
but failed to publish the results.[^post]

Note that the Church-Turing thesis would not even be proposed for another five years,
and that the definition of computation was still unsettled.
It was crucial that the proof techniques that GÃ¶del used were incontrovertible,
and had to appeal to our intuitive notion of computation.
GÃ¶del himself remained somewhat skeptical of his 1931 result until he saw
Turing's famous results.[^godelTM1] [^godelTM2]

In 1941, Haskell Curry devised a formalization of primitive recursive arithmetic
using only equality of terms (and no logical connectives)[^curryPRA].

Here is a timeline to help visualize the story.
I've drawn two vertical lines, one to mark when the Church-Turing thesis was announced
and one to to mark when the ENIAC was created.

### Provably total

The primitive recursive functions also show up naturally inside of Peano Arithmetic.
In order to describe this connection, we need to define what it means for a function to
be provably total.

We say that a function \\(f:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}\\) is described by a formula
\\(F\\) in Peano Arithmetic if:

\\[
f(x) = y \\Longleftrightarrow F(x, y) \\text{ is true}
\\]

where "F is true" means that the formula holds when you interpret the variables
as natural numbers (and the addition symbol as addition, etc).

We say that a function \\(f:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}\\) is
**provably total** (inside Peano Arithmetic) if there exists
a formula \\(F\\) in Peano Arithmetic which describes \\(f\\) and which can be proved to be total. 
In other words, there are proofs of:

* For every \\(y\\in\\mathbb{N}\\), there exists \\(x\\in\\mathbb{N}\\), such that
\\(F(x, y)\\).
* For every \\(y_1, y_2, x\\in\\mathbb{N}\\), if \\(F(x, y_1)\\) and \\(F(x, y_1)\\)
  hold, then \\(y_1 = y_2\\) also holds.

Parson's theorem states that the primitive recursive functions are exactly those
functions which are provably total in a certain a subsystem of Peano arithmetic
named \\(\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma_1\\).
Peano arithmetic allows for induction over any formula,
and \\(\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma_1\\) is the restriction of Peano Arithmetic to formulas
of the form \\(\\exists x\\phi(x)\\), where \\(\\phi(x)\\) contains only
bounded quantifiers[^boundedqs].

Parson's theorem is often stated in the form of a conservation theorem:
if \\(\\phi\\) is a formula of the form \\(\\forall x\\exists y\\theta(x, y)\\)
(where \\(\\theta\\) is bounded)
and is provable in \\(\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma_1\\),
then \\(\\phi\\) is also provable in primitive recursive arithmetic.

These two statements are equivalent since the formula expressing the totality of a
primitive recursive function has the right form:
\\(\\forall x\\exists y~f(x)=y\\).
Note that "\\(f(x)=y\\)" is not necessarily captured by a bounded formula.
It is, however, captured by a \\(\\exists x\\phi(x)\\) formula by
[Kleene's normal form theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_T_predicate#Normal_form_theorem)
(and you can always collapse two consecutive existential quantifiers into one).
Indeed, tetration is primitive recursive but not definable by a bounded formula of PA.
(For a neat example of the difference between primitive recursion and bounded formulas,
you can consider the latter to be loop programs where the variable used to loop cannot change[^not_delta_0].)

### Partial realization of Hilbert's program

While the incompleteness did show that Hilbert's program was impossible in its entirety,
a partial realization was found in 1976 by Harvey Friedman
and used primitive recursive arithmetic.[^partialhilbert]

There is an fairly expressive logical system named
\\(\\mathsf{WKL}_0\\) which asserts the existence of actual infinity in some circumstances.

An illustrative example of Weak KÅ‘nig's lemma (for which this system is named) is the following.
Suppose you have a collection a finite binary sequences which form a tree
(meaning it is closed under initial sub-sequences).
Suppose also that there is an algorithm which can determine which finite binary sequence
are in the collection.
The tree might be infinite, but the algorithm describes it as a potential infinity.
Weak KÅ‘nig's lemma states if the tree is infinite then there exists an infinite path
through the tree.
Moreover, we can construct such a tree so that no infinite path through the tree is
described by an algorithm, even though the sequences that comprise the tree are
described by an algorithm.
In this sense, Weak KÅ‘nig's lemma calls forth actual infinity out of potential infinity.

The partial realization of Hilbert's program is:

Every formula of the form \\(\\forall x\\exists y\\phi(x, y)\\)
(where \\(\\theta\\) is bounded) which is provable in \\(\\mathsf{WKL}_0\\)
is also provable in primitive recursive arithmetic.[^wkl0-conserve]

In other words, the use of actual infinity inside \\(\\mathsf{WKL}_0\\)
can often be replace with "finitistic methods".
To see many examples of important mathematical theorems that can be proved
with \\(\\mathsf{WKL}_0\\), see Simpson's book.[^wkl0-list]



## Generalization

After seeing Parson's theorem, it is natural to wonder if there is a good description
of *all* the provably total functions of Peano Arithmetic.
Indeed there is, and one such description involves a generalization of the primitive recursive functions
called the **primitive recursive functionals**.

In 1958, GÃ¶del used the primitive recursive functionals to prove
the consistency of Peano Arithmetic.[^dialectica]
The primitive recursive functionals are terms in a logical calculus
that GÃ¶del invented, now called System T.
One of GÃ¶del's results about System T is that every provably total function of
Peano Arithmetic is denoted by a term in System T.
The reverse is also true.

Interestingly, though Peano Arithmetic can prove that any given primitive recursive functional
is total, it **cannot** prove that
"for all primitive recursive functionals f, f is total",
as this would contradict GÃ¶del's second incompleteness theorem.
In other words, this universal quantifier on the functionals cannot be moved
from outside the meta-theory to inside the meta-theory.

Note that Georg Kreisel characterized the provably total functions of Peano Arithmetic
in 1952 using a different classification,
namely the "ordinal recursive functionals below \\(\\epsilon_0\\)"[^kreisel52].

### Intuition via functional programming

Before we define the primitive recursive functionals, we start with an example
from functional programming.

The first thing to note is how similar the natural numbers are to lists.
Numbers are described by "start with zero, then keep applying the successor function".
Lists are described by "start with the empty list, then keep appending elements".
In other words, the natural numbers are like lists whose values are ignored.

One of the mostly useful functions on lists is `fold`.
It is not a coincidence that `fold` is useful, as it just reverses the construction of a list. 
Much like a proof by induction, fold takes the following:

* a base case (for the empty list)
* a step case (for handling one element of the list, in the context of an intermediate calculation)

With these two inputs, `fold` returns a function from an arbitrary list to
whatever type of data the two cases return.

In Haskell, (the right) fold looks like this:

```haskell
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr step base [] = base
foldr step base (x:xs) = step x (foldr step base xs)
```

What would `fold` on the natural numbers look like?

It is nearly the same as `foldr`, except that it does not have to handle the list elements.
We write it out in Haskell, and give it the name `iter` for "iterator".

```haskell
-- Peano Numerals
data â„• = Z | S â„•
```

```haskell
-- iterator on â„•
iter :: (b -> b) -> b -> â„• -> b
iter step base Z = base
iter step base (S n) = step (iter step base n)
```

For the same reason that induction is the primary tool for proofs of statements
about the natural numbers, the iterator is the primary tool for functions on the natural numbers.
We can use it to define addition, multiplication, exponentiation, etc.

```haskell
add :: â„• -> â„• -> â„•
add m n = iter m S n
```

```haskell
mult :: â„• -> â„• -> â„•
mult m n = iter Z (add m) n
```

```haskell
ex :: â„• -> â„• -> â„•
ex m n = iter (S Z) (mult m) n
```

So far this looks a lot like primitive recursion.
This is because we've only used `iter` in the case where the type `b` is \\(\\mathbb{N}\\).
Things get interesting when we let `b` have higher order.
In fact, we can use `iter` to define the Ackermann function,
and we will need to let `b` be \\(\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}\\).

Recall the definition of the Ackermann function:

\\[
\\begin{array}{lcl}
    A(0, n) & = & n + 1 \\\\
    A(m+1, 0) & = & A(m, 1) \\\\
    A(m+1, n+1) & = & A(m, A(m+1, n)) \\\\
\\end{array}
\\]

The last case looks like a straight-forward use of the iterator (with `b` as \\(\\mathbb{N}\\)).
So we can start by defining the Ackermann function using a single case statement:

```haskell
one :: â„•
one = S Z

```

```haskell
ack' :: â„• -> â„• -> â„•
ack' Z = S
ack' (S m) = iter (ack' m) (ack' m one)
```

Written this way, we can see an opportunity to use the iterator a second time!
But instead of using `iter` to produce natural numbers,
we will use it to produce *functions* from natural numbers to natural numbers:

* base case - the successor function
* step case - the function obtained by iterating the previous "row" of the ackerman function

Which looks like this:

```haskell
ack :: â„• -> â„• -> â„•
ack = iter step S
  where
    step ackm = iter ackm (ackm one)
```

The function `iter` is referred to as a *catamorphism* in the function programming world.
The dual notion is called an *anamorphism*, and these ideas lead to all kind of fun
in functional programming.[^bananas]

### Definition of the primitive recursive functionals

Loosely speaking, the primitive recursive functionals are the functions that you can define
using `iter`, where `b` is any type built up from \\(\\mathbb{N}\\)
and the function arrow \\(\\to\\)
(for example, \\(\\mathbb{N}\\to(\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N})\\to\\mathbb{N}\\)).
These types are usually called the "finite types".

More precisely, the finite types are those defined by the grammar:
\\[                                                                                                 
\\tau ::= \\mathbb{N} ~| ~\\tau\\to\\tau                                                            
\\]  


The **primitive recursive functionals** are the functions that you make using:

* the constant function \\(n\\mapsto 0\\)
* the successor function \\(n\\mapsto n+1\\)
* the S, K, and R combinators over the finite types

I will write out definitions of these combinators using Haskell
(ignoring the restriction to the finite types).

The K combinator is just the projection of a pair onto the first coordinate:

```haskell
k :: a -> b -> a
k a b = a
```

The S combinator "fuses" (schmelzen in German, from SchÃ¶nfinkel[^schonfinkel]) the occurrences
of `x` in `(f x)(g x)`:

```haskell
s :: (a -> b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
s f g x = f x (g x)
```

Finally, the R combinator is the recursor and is only slightly different than `iter`.

Note that `iter` does not pass the "counter" to the step function.
Doing so results in what is called the "recursor".

```haskell
-- iterator of â„•
iter :: (b -> b) -> b -> â„• -> b
iter step base Z = base
iter step base (S n) = step (iter step base n)

-- recursor of â„•
recursor :: (â„• -> b -> b) -> b -> â„• -> b
recursor step base Z = base
recursor step base (S n) = step b (recursor step base n)
```

## Closing

I will end this post with a peek into another beautiful world, namely second-order arithmetic.

Second-order arithmetic adds the notion of sets of natural numbers to Peano arithmetic.
In fact, the system \\(WKL_0\\) mentioned earlier is a subsystem of second-order arithmetic.
An incredible amount of interesting mathematics can be expressed in second-order arithmetic.

Moreover, in the same way that System T captures the provably total functions of Peano arithmetic,
there is an analogous system for second-order arithmetic called System F.

System F was discovered independently by the computer scientist John Reynolds
and by the logician Jean-Yves Girard,
and it provides the theoretical underpinnings of Haskell[^ghc_core] and ML.
