# This is not a real post :)

It is just a temporary cheatsheet and style check for myself.

# Mathjax

Math can be inline, such as \\( e^{\\pi i}+1=0 \\).

It can also be centered:
\\[ \\sigma \\leftrightarrow \\beta\\left(\\mathsf{S}^{\\#\\sigma}\\bf{0}\\right) \\]

# Code

We can have code blocks:

```haskell
fac :: (Num b, Enum b) => b -> b
fac n = foldr (*) 1 [1..n]
```

And inline code, such as `fac 3`.

# Markdown

Unordered lists:

* banana
* apple
* orange

Ordered list:

1. coffee
2. coffee
3. coffee

This is *italics* and this is **bold**.

Translation of a quote from Grothendieck’s memoir -

> In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more brilliant than I have gone on to become
distinguished mathematicians. Still from the perspective or thirty or thirty five years, I can
state that their imprint upon the mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They’ve done
all things, often beautiful things in a context that was already set out before them, which they
had no inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained prisoners of those
invisible and despotic circles which delimit the universe of a certain milieu in a given era.
To have broken these bounds they would have to rediscover in themselves that capability which was
their birthright, as it was mine: The capacity to be alone.
